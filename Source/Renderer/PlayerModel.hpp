// PlayerModel — shared player-character model.
//
// Every other player you see online is drawn from ONE shared asset resolved
// here, so "can remote players be seen at all?" reduces to a single question:
// did EnsureLoaded() succeed? It is written so the answer is always yes unless
// every rung of the fallback chain failed, and so a failure is temporary rather
// than permanent.
//
// RESOLUTION ORDER (first that loads wins, and the winner is logged)
//   1. `mesh` / `texture` on the "Player" LightningScript def, when it names a
//      mesh. This is the authoring hook — point it anywhere.
//   2. GameData/Global/Player/Plague_Arcanist.glb — the guaranteed default.
//      Rigged, embedded textures, no external file to lose.
//   3. GameData/Global/Player/Character_Killer_01.glb + .png — the historical
//      default. Static, so it can never animate, but it is tiny.
//   4. Nothing loaded: the caller draws a primitive placeholder.
//
// WHY THE RETRY
// -------------
// The previous version latched `m_tried = true` on its FIRST call regardless
// of the outcome, so a single unlucky early call — before the .ozls defs were
// registered, or before a package was hot-loaded — pinned the whole session to
// the placeholder capsule. Load failure now only rate-limits: we retry on a
// later frame, and a late-arriving def heals itself. Invalidate() resets it on
// a world load, where the def map is re-pointed anyway.
//
// Assets with clips load as a SkeletalMesh; without clips they load as a static
// mesh. Playback state stays with the caller (see DrawRemotePlayers3D).
// Client-only.
