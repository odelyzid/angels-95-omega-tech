// Level state: the game type, the rules, the skyboxes and the ambient particles.
// Persisted through the OZONE `levelinfo` / `particles` lines.
//
// MOVED HERE IN R6 from UI/UiPanels.hpp. The plan document had this right and the
// code did not: "It is level state and belongs in Subsystems/LevelState; it only
// appears to live in UI/ because the deleted Zone window used to mirror it into a
// global." LevelMetadata is read by WorldIO on load and OzoneExport on save, and
// written by the Map row - none of which are UI. Its accessor was even IMPLEMENTED
// inside UI/Panels/LevelState.cpp, so the state a subsystem owns was reachable only
// because the whole UI layer is one translation unit.
//
// ParticleType moves with it for the same reason: it is the ambient-particle kind,
// i.e. level state, and it was only declared in a UI header because LevelMetadata
// lived there. Subsystems/LevelState.hpp must not include UI/UiPanels.hpp - that
// would be a Subsystems-to-UI dependency, which is the layer rule backwards.
