//
// Shared editor state: menu command IDs, the AutoConvex budget, the event-pass
// buffers, and the selection / mouse / gizmo state that Core, Subsystems and UI all
// read.
//
// Split out of Core/EditorShell.hpp in R6. EditorShell.hpp used to be a preamble AND
// a state header AND - the actual reason for the split - the home of thirteen
// RaycastTest* picking functions whose ONLY caller is Subsystems/Selection.cpp.
// Picking logic sitting in a state header is what made that file 420 lines and
// unreadable; those functions moved down to their caller.
//
// Everything here is `static`, i.e. internal to the one translation unit of Main.cpp.
// That is deliberate for now and is what R6 phase F changes: promoting Subsystems/
// to real translation units means the genuinely shared subset moves to `inline
// variables here and the rest stays private to its fragment.
