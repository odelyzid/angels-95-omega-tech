#version 330

// Sky.fs - horizon fog for the skybox cube.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// World geometry fogs, the skybox did not. The two programs disagree where the
// world's most distant geometry ends and the sky begins, so there was a hard
// horizontal line across every outdoor view: crisp, fully-hazed geometry below
// it and an untouched sky above it. With a painted backdrop behind that line the
// result read as cardboard scenery pasted onto the sky, which is the specific
// look the FAKEBACKDROP flag exists to avoid.
//
// THE FIX
//
// Two terms, multiplied:
//
//   1. HOW MUCH fog there is at this fragment's distance. This is fogFactorAt(),
//      copied VERBATIM from LitFog.fs / Surface.fs. Reusing the real function is
//      what makes the seam close by construction: at the horizon the sky and the
//      geometry behind it evaluate the same formula at the same distance, so they
//      agree on the colour no matter what fogStart/fogEnd/fogDensity a level
//      authors. A flat "blend fully at the horizon" would only agree for levels
//      whose fog is already near-opaque at 700 units - and would over-haze a clear
//      day's sky, replacing one mismatch with a different one.
//
//   2. WHERE on the sky we are. The sky cube's side faces are vertical planes
//      through the camera's own height, so the true horizon is always at
//      dir.y == 0 and the quantity that distinguishes "overhead sky" from "haze
//      at the skyline" is the view ray's elevation. Above kSkyHorizonBlend the
//      artwork is untouched; below it the fog term wins.
//
// The product is what closes the seam: term 1 alone would fog the whole sky
// uniformly (it is a distance term, and the cube is at a fixed distance), and term
// 2 alone would be wrong at any fog density other than "maximal".
//
// With fogDensity 0, term 1 is 0, so the sky renders EXACTLY as it did before
// this file existed. That is the fallback path, not a special case.
//
// GAMMA
//
// Deliberately NOT gamma-corrected, which is pre-existing behaviour and is
// preserved: the surrounding world geometry IS gamma-corrected (LitFog.fs applies
// pow(1/2.2)) and the fog colour is mixed in after gamma on both sides. Changing
// the sky's transfer function here would MOVE the horizon rather than remove it,
// because the entire point is to meet that post-gamma fog colour.
//
// Uniform names match LitFog.fs / Surface.fs so OzoneLoader can publish the same
// world state to all three programs. Keep fogFactorAt() in sync with both copies.
