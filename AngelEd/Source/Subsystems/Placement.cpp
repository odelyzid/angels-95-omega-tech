// ApplyPlacementSpawns - R5: the world-mutation half of entity placement.
//
// Until this existed, SpawnSelectedPawnTreeItem in UI/Panels/PawnPanel.cpp called
// PawnSystem::Add* / ZoneManager::AddZone directly from a WM_COMMAND handler. That
// broke the layer rule stated in Wiki/Editor-Architecture-Refactor.md:
// "A panel posts an event; it never mutates the world directly. If a UI/ file calls
// PawnSystem::Add*, the layer rule is already broken."
//
// The panel now does the validation (which is what its error MessageBox needs, and
// it must stay synchronous for that) and posts one ed::Spawn* event carrying
// everything this file needs. Nothing is read from live panel or selection state
// here, so a tree rebuild or a selection change between the click and the frame
// cannot place a different entity.
//
// ONE POSITION, NOT TWO. g_editorPanels.spawnPos is assigned from
// OTEditor.MainCamera.target every frame in Main.cpp, so there is no separate
// "ghost position" - the camera aim point IS the placement point. An earlier draft of
// the plan claimed the old actionSpawn* handlers would have placed "at MainCamera.target
// instead of the ghost position, so they were not merely redundant but wrong". That was
// wrong: they would have been behaviourally identical. Recorded in the R1 notes because
// it was the strongest stated reason to keep placement synchronous, and that reason
// does not exist.

// Placement events, drained from the bus by ApplyPlacementSpawns. Kept as its own
// vector, not shared with g_editorFrameEvents, for the reason the surface and anim
// passes have theirs: so this file's handlers can be lifted into a real translation
// unit later without that move having to reorder the selection dispatch.

// How many times ApplyPlacementSpawns ran without a recognised payload. A Spawn*
// kind with no case here would otherwise be a silent no-op, which is exactly how
// the nine dead actionSpawn* fields survived as long as they did.
