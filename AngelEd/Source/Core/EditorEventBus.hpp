// AngelEd editor event bus — the replacement for EditorPanelState's 58 loose
// `action*` fields.
//
// Raylib-free AND Win32-free on purpose. That is what makes the central invariant
// testable from the headless suites: the 58 fields it replaces are only reachable
// from inside a WM_COMMAND handler and a raylib frame loop, so today none of
// them can be verified without clicking. Same discipline as ZoneTypes.hpp,
// GameType.hpp and SurfaceFlags.hpp.
//
// See Wiki/Editor-Architecture-Refactor.md for the design and the phased plan.
