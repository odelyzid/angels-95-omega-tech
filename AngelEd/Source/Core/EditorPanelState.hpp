// The single shared UI/selection/undo state object. MOVED HERE in R9 from
// UI/UiPanels.hpp, and that move was forced rather than cosmetic.
//
// EditorPanelState is 374 lines and is read by everything: Core, Subsystems and UI.
// It was DECLARED in a UI header and DEFINED in UI/UiCommon.hpp, so every Subsystems/
// file that touched it (PropsApply alone reads 85 of its fields) had to include a UI
// header - and once Subsystems/ became real translation units that meant linking every
// one of them against UiShell.o just to reach the state.
//
// It is editor state, not a UI API surface. The Design section of
// Wiki/Editor-Architecture-Refactor.md has said "Core/ - frame loop, editor state"
// since R0; this is that line finally being true.
//
// Two things deliberately did NOT move with it: the Win32 window HANDLEs stay behind
// the #ifdef _WIN32 below, and EditorPanelState remains one flat struct rather than
// being split per concern. Splitting it is the obvious next step, and a much larger
// change than relocating it.
